# Regatta Group Junior Technical Test
Welcome to the Regatta Group Junior Developer technical test. This app is built on Vue 2 along with Javascript and Bootstrap.

## The Goal
The goal of this test is to create a product page based on the desktop design in the file `src/assets/design/Design.png` using the data provided to you in the file `src/components/data/product.json`. Additionally, there are bugs within the app that need to be found and fixed before the page build can start.

The main file you will be working on in this app is `src/components/Product.vue`.

##### Additional
- Make the page fully responsive to how you see fit.
- Create Vue/Javascript functionality to work out the percentage saving and display it on the page.
- Create Vue/Javascript functionality where when you select a size and press the add to bag button, an alert box appears with the text 'You have selected size: [SIZE]'.
